# CY2001
This repository contains the codes used to generate the plots as well as the boulder data collected over the course of the project.
Condensed Boulder Data.xlsx contains collected boulder data from papers that are linked within the Excel file. This boulder data was used to run the models.
Goto Analysis.ipynb is a Python file used to perform analysis on Goto's models. The code used to generate boulder speed and current velocity plots can be found here. 
Interesting Plots.ipynb is a Python file used to generate the density plots for Engel and May, Nandasena and Goto models. It was also used to generate the Pignatelli model's scatter plots. The function used to filter the data base and run the models is also included here.
RMSE Functions.ipynb is a Python file used to generate the RMSE plots. The function used to filter the data base and run the models is also included here.
